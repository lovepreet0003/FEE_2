                <h3>Personal life</h3>
                <p>Moose Wala lived in his home village of Moosa, which his fans often visited to meet him.[77] He was
                    very attached to his grandmother and kept his hair at her request, which is very important in
                    Sikhism; his father could not keep his hair due to an accident.</p>


                <summary>Moose Wala had a rivalry with Karan Aujla; both have replied to each other through songs, on
                    social media, and in live performances.[79][80] Both have also been criticised for songs promoting
                    violence.[81] In an interview their mutual colleague Elly Mangat disclosed that the dispute between
                    them began when Moose Wala's video targeting Aujla in his song was leaked to Aujla's management, and
                    they threatened to attack Moose Wala. Following the incident, both started targeting each other on
                    social media.[82][83] The rivalry was resolved temporarily until Aujla released a diss track,
                    "Lafaafe", which Moose Wala responded to with "Warning Shots".[40] Aujla in an interview stated that
                    he did not write the track "Lafaafe" and did not reveal anything about their rivalry, but praised
                    Moose Wala's work.[84] After his death, Aujla paid tribute with the song "Maa"</summary>

                        village of Mansa at age of 28. According to police, Lawrence Bishnoi's gang initially claimed
                        responsibility for the murder in an unverified Facebook post, which Bishnoi denied making,[117]
                        and he was being held by the Punjab Police as of June 2022 and was considered the "mastermind"

                        left his house with his cousin Gurpreet Singh and neighbour Gurwinder Singh. Moose Wala was

                    <p>Moose Wala was among the 424 people whose police security was reduced or entirely removed the day
                        before, in preparation for the anniversary of Operation Blue Star, leaving him with two
                        commandos instead of the earlier four.[123][124] At the time of the incident, Moose Wala was
                        travelling in his private car accompanied by two others instead of his bullet-proof vehicle with
                        the commandos.[125][126] According to his friends, Moose Wala did not take his security along
                        with him, as his Thar SUV could not accommodate five people</p>

                    <p>On 30 May, the Delhi unit of the INC staged a protest near AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal's residence
                        holding the AAP-ruled Government of Punjab responsible for the incident, blaming their decision
                        to curtail Moose Wala's security cover . His autopsy was carried out by five doctors, and the
                        event was videographed. According to post mortem reports, Moose Wala received 19 bullet
                        injuries, and he died within 15 minutes of being shot due to the wounds</p>
