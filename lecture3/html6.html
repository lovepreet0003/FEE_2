                <p>Sherlock Holmes (/ˈʃɜːrlɒk ˈhoʊmz/) is a fictional detective created by British author Arthur Conan
                    Doyle. Referring to himself as a "consulting detective" in his stories, Holmes is known for his
                    proficiency with observation, deduction, forensic science and logical reasoning that borders on the
                    fantastic, which he employs when investigating cases for a wide variety of clients, including
                    Scotland Yard.</p>

                <p>The character Sherlock Holmes first appeared in print in 1887's A Study in Scarlet. His popularity
                    became widespread with the first series of short stories in The Strand Magazine, beginning with "A
                    Scandal in Bohemia" in 1891; additional tales appeared from then until 1927, eventually totalling
                    four novels and 56 short stories. </p>
                <p>All but one[a] are set in the Victorian or Edwardian eras between 1880 and 1914. Most are narrated by
                    the character of Holmes's friend and biographer, Dr. John H. Watson, who usually accompanies Holmes
                    during his investigations and often shares quarters with him at the address of 221B Baker Street,
                    London, where many of the stories begin</p>

                    Though not the first fictional detective, Sherlock Holmes is arguably the best-known.[1] By the
                    1990s, over 25,000 stage adaptations, films, television productions, and publications were already
                    featuring the detective,[2] and Guinness World Records lists him as the most portrayed human
                    literary character in film and television history.[3] Holmes's popularity and fame are such that
                    many have believed him to be not a fictional character but an actual individual;[4][5][6] numerous
                    literary and fan societies have been founded on this pretence. Avid readers of the Holmes stories
                    helped create the modern practice of fandom.[7] The character and stories have had a profound and
                    lasting effect on mystery writing and popular culture as a whole, with the original tales, as well
                    as thousands written by authors other than Conan Doyle, being adapted into stage and radio plays,
                    television, films, video games, and other media for over one hundred years

                First two Sherlock Holmes stories, the novels A Study in Scarlet (1887) and The Sign of the Four (1890),
                were moderately well received, but Holmes first became very popular early in 1891 when the first six
                short stories featuring the character were published in The Strand Magazine. Holmes became widely known
                in Britain and America.[1] The character was so well known that in 1893 when Arthur Conan Doyle killed
                Holmes in the short story "The Final Problem", the strongly negative response from readers was unlike
                any previous public reaction to a fictional event. The Strand reportedly lost more than 20,000
                subscribers as a result of Holmes's death. Public pressure eventually contributed to Conan Doyle writing
                another Holmes story in 1901 and resurrecting the character in a story published in 1903.[7] In Japan,
                Sherlock Holmes (and Alice from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland) became immensely popular in the
                country in the 1890s as it was opening up to the West, and they are cited as two British fictional
                Victorians who left an enormous creative and cultural legacy there.
